def initialize():
    set GPIO to use board pin numbering and to ignore warnings

    setup all GPIO pins powering LEDs and buttons to output
    setup all GPIO pins reading button power to input with pull-down resistor
    power on pin 11 for buttons

    display introductory text and raw_input field to start game with

    declare global variables sequence, led_delay, and level
    set new vars lost and checked to False

    countdown from 5 in terminal to game start

    while lost is False:
        add a level and display current level in the terminal

        add a random integer between 34 and 37 (with 34 set to 33 by single_led if necessary) to sequence
        flash each LED, with led_delay between power on/off
        flash all LEDs thrice to indicate user's turn

        for each LED in sequence
            set checked to False
            while checked is False, scan all buttons for input
                if input is detected, check if the button's corresponding LED matches that of the current sequence LED
                    if so, set checked to True and flash the corresponding LED
                    else set checked and lost to True, and flash the correct LED 5 times
            break if lost is True
        
        if lost is True, pass
            else flash all LEDs thrice to indicate all buttons were correct

           wait 1 second before continuing
# End gameplay

def endgame():
    print a congratulatory message with the final level

    disable all powered pins and run GPIO built-in cleanup function
    wait for 5 seconds before ending game

if program was started directly:
    create lists of all LED power and button input GPIO pins

    create placeholder vars for sequence, led-delay, and level
    create a dictionary of button pins matched to LED pins
    create a lambda function to set a value of 34 to 33, but nothing else, to fix random number generation
