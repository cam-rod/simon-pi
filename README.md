# Simon Pi

This game let's you play Simon, the game with 4 flashing light and 4 buttons, with your Raspberry Pi and some hardware. To play the game, you'll need the following hardware components (besides a display, keyboard, and mouse):

- 4 LEDs
- 4 buttons
- 1 resistor
- Jumper cables and wires

Once you have these components, unzip [Documentation.zip](Documentation.zip) and read the file *RodriguezCameronOutline.docx* for wiring. Then, start [the Python file](simon.py) and have fun!

Made for ICS4U1, or Grade 12 Computer Science, in Python 2.
